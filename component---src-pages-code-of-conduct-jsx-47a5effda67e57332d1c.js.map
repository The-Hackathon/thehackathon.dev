threatening, offensive, or harmful.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or\n        reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits,

<h2>Scope</h2>\n\n      <p>\n        This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also\n        applies when an individual is officially representing the community in\n        public spaces.
